#I identified several issues with the data during this process.
--> Mariona Garcia of Salem (WV) was not on team's official roster.
--> Neither ESPN nor the official Oakland roster listed height for Brooke Daniels.
--> Neither ESPN nor the official Oakland roster listed height for Eve Pardo.
--> Neither ESPN nor the official Oakland roster listed height for Lianna Baxter of Oakland.
--> Pomona-Pitzer is a special case and requires a different scrape become of the nature of the joint nature of the team. Here is the link to the roster: https://www.sagehens.com/sports/wbkb/2022-23/roster
